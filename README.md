**what is?**

it's a website to make sounds. It uses "Web Audio" a HTML5 Javascript API.

it has the ability to create multiple inputs and effects and combine them into a single output node that makes the
sounds audible to the listener. this output node's sound gets analyzed to determine what note it is (like a guitar tuner)

It's visible on github pages here: http://maxpleaner.github.io/muzak
